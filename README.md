## Device Support

This software is powered by the [OpenRazer](https://openrazer.github.io) daemon, check
their [supported devices](https://openrazer.github.io/#devices) grid to confirm whether your device is
supported by the daemon. If the daemon supports it, Polychromatic will see it too.

Due to the diversity of devices, not all of a device's features may be supported right away.
[Check out the roadmap](https://polychromatic.app/docs/roadmap/) for progress.

DBus, the daemon and the driver. [Check if an issue already exists](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/issues)
